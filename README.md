# Static Factory: Intern's Journey

## Design Philosophy

This game is created with a strict adherence to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, allowing for continuous addition of client requirements without disruption. The design focuses on breaking down the system into smaller, more manageable classes to promote modularity and encapsulation. 

Each class has a clear and distinct responsibility, making the system easier to understand and maintain. By following the **SOLID** principles and the **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, the system is designed for easy extension and promotes reusability. This involves identifying common functionalities and abstracting them into reusable components while anticipating potential changes to enhance code flexibility and adaptability to evolving requirements and future extensions.

## Overview

In **"Static Factory,"** you play as an Intern tasked with collecting valuable scraps from abandoned moons to support the factory’s production system. Your first mission takes you to the moon **Polymorphia**, where you must navigate various challenges, gather resources, and survive against hostile creatures.

## Game Features

### Player Character:
- You control the Intern (represented by `@`), starting with 4 hit points (HP) and a nearly limitless inventory.

### Environment:
- The Intern begins in a spaceship made of floors (`_`) surrounded by walls (`#`).
- Scraps are scattered across the map, including large bolts (`+`) and metal sheets (`%`).

### Objectives:
- Collect scraps and meet factory quotas while surviving against hostile fauna and exploring the moon’s flora.

### Hostile Creatures:
- Huntsman spiders (`8`) spawn in craters (`u`) with a 5% chance each turn.
- Additional hostile creatures like Alien Bugs (`a`) and Suspicious Astronauts (`ඞ`) also pose threats.

### Resource Management:
- Find special scraps, such as metal pipes, and consumables like Jars of Pickles (`n`) and Pots of Gold (`$`), each with unique effects on health and inventory.

### Interactions:
- Use a Computer Terminal (`=`) to purchase items with collected credits.
- Teleportation is enabled through **THESEUS** (`^`), allowing instant movement within a map.

### Progression:
- After meeting scrap quotas, return to the factory to sell collected resources and embark on new missions to other moons, such as **Refactorio**.

### Flora:
- Discover the **Inheritree**, which can grow and produce fruits valuable for factory production.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Movement**: Navigate through your spaceship and across the moon's surface while avoiding walls.
- **Combat**: Engage with hostile creatures using a turn-based system.
- **Inventory Management**: Collect and utilize a variety of scraps and resources to aid your survival.
